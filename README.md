## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt how to create a Off canvas menu and linking to my HTML file.

At the bottom of the HTML file I added a Script tag``` <script>``` in order for the HTML file and the Javascript file to link.

When creating the Offset menu I had to make a funcation which would add a class and also remove it. that class would be ```.active``` and that would allow the offcanvas menu to be able to appear and disappear. 

### Continued development

I would like to work with Javascript more and incorporate it within my projects.

### Useful resources

- [Mdn Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me refresh my mind for different classes. I appricate how easy the website is to use when looking for information.
